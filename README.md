# DiscreteFourierTransform

The DFT is primary tool in digital signal processing. So, we will see how it works and how we can implement it within MATLAB and discover  its relationship with SNR.

- First of all I created a sinus Pulse with two frequencies f0 and f1 to test if DFT can detect them or not.

- Secondly, I added some noise to my original sinus with various values of SNR.

- In the end I plotted the DFT in Frequency Domain and extract the relationship between the DFT and SNR.
